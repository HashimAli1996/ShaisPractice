# Arithmetic Operations

print (10 / 3) # Division
print (10 // 3) # Gives integer
print (10 % 3) # Modulas. gives
print (10 * 3) # Multiply
print (10 ** 3) # To the power of ?. example 10 ** 3 = 10 x 10 x 10

x = 10 # x is worth 10 here.
x = x + 3 # The x that is worth 10 has now increased by 3, so the value now has been overwritten for the print # statement to 13.
print(x)


x = 10
#x = x + 3
x += 3 # works same as previous line. can be changed to / * - as well
print(x)


x = 10 + 3 * 2
print(x)
